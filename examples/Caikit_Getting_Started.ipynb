        "### 1. Installing Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, we'll install the following Python packages using `pip`:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `evaluate`: A library for evaluating model performance on different NLP tasks.\n",
        "- `rouge_score`: A package for calculating ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metrics for text summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that these libraries may have dependencies, so we'll ensure all the necessary requirements are met during the installation process.\n",

        "This is a command-line instruction to run a Python script called `run_peft_tuning.py` using the python interpreter. It is part of the `caikit-nlp` package and is meant to tune a pre-trained model (in this case t5-base) on a specific dataset (in this case glue/rte) using different parameter efficient tuning approaches, e.g., MPT.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's explain each argument in the command:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `caikit-nlp/examples/run_peft_tuning.py`: This specifies the path to the Python script that will be executed. It is a part of the caikit-nlp library and contains the implementation of the PEFT approach.\n",
        "1. `MULTITASK_PROMPT_TUNING`: This is the option recognized by the `run_peft_tuning.py` script, indicating the type of tuning or learning strategy to be used. In this case, it's \"Multitask Prompt Tuning.\" (The alternative option is `PROMPT_TUNING` which has slightly different options. )\n",
        "1. `--dataset \\\"glue/rte\\\"`: This specifies the dataset to be used for tuning. In this example, the dataset is `glue/rte` which is subset of the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark containing the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task.\n",
        "1. `--model_name t5-base`: This indicates the base model that will be used for prompt tuning. In this case, it's `t5-base`, which refers to the T5-base model from Hugging Face.\n",
        "1. `--num_epochs 1`: This sets the number of epochs (training iterations) for the prompt-tuning process. Here, it's set to 1, meaning the model will go through the dataset once during prompt-tuning.\n",
        "1. ` --verbose`: This is a flag to enable verbose or detailed output during the training process. It will cause the script to print more information about the training progress.\n",
        "1. `--num_virtual_tokens 100`: This sets the number of virtual tokens used for prompt tuning. Prompt tuning involves freezing the weights of a base model and learning `soft prompts`, which can be concatenated to the inputs when running text generation on the model.\n",
        "1. `--prompt_tuning_init RANDOM`: This specifies the method used for initializing prompt tuning. In this case, it's set to \"RANDOM,\" meaning the prompt tuning will start with random values.\n",
        "1. `--output_dir tmp/foo`: This sets the directory where the prompt-tuned model and related outputs will be stored. In this case, it's set to the `tmp/foo` directory.\n",
        "1. `--learning_rate 0.3`: This sets the learning rate for the optimization process during prompt-tuning. The learning rate controls the step size in gradient descent.\n",
        "1. `--batch_size=12`: This sets the batch size used during training. The data will be divided into batches of 12 samples each.\n",
        "1. `--accumulate_steps 16`: This specifies the number of steps before gradients are accumulated and the weights are updated. It can be useful for larger batch sizes when the GPU memory is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this command line script is prompt-tuning the T5-base model using the MPT approach on the `glue/rte` dataset, with specific settings for learning rate, batch size, accumulation steps, and so on.
