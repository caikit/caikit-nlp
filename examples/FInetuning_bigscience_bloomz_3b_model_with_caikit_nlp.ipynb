        "In this example Jupyter notebook, we'll be using various Python libraries and pre-trained models for evaluating and analyzing natural language processing tasks. Before we proceed, we need to install the required dependencies and download some essential resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Installing Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, we'll install the following Python packages using `pip`:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `evaluate`: A library for evaluating model performance on different NLP tasks.\n",
        "- `rouge_score`: A package for calculating ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metrics for text summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that these libraries may have dependencies, so we'll ensure all the necessary requirements are met during the installation process.\n",

        "!pip install rouge_score\n",

        "\n",
        "Next, we'll install specific versions of the caikit and caikit-nlp libraries, as the project is still in beta and breaking changes can happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "!pip install git+https://github.com/caikit/caikit@v0.11.3\n",
        "!pip install git+https://github.com/caikit/caikit-nlp\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Downloading Additional Resources\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to explore the capabilities of pre-trained models, we'll need to download the caikit-nlp repository.\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have all the necessary libraries and resources installed, we can move on to the next steps in our NLP analysis using these powerful tools!"

        "1. `caikit-nlp/examples/run_peft_tuning.py`: This specifies the path to the Python script that will be executed. It is a part of the caikit-nlp library and contains the implementation of the PEFT approach.\n",
        "1. `--dataset \"billsum\"`: This specifies the dataset to be used for tuning. In this example, the dataset is `billsum` which is a summary of US Congressional and California State Bills [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/billsum).\n",
        "1. `--model_name bigscience/bloomz-3b`: This indicates the base model that will be used for fine tuning. In this case, it's `bigscience/bloomz-3b`, which refers to the GPT2-Medium model from Hugging Face [link](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz-3b).\n",
        "1. `--num_epochs 3`: This sets the number of epochs (training iterations) for the prompt-tuning process. Here, it's set to 3, meaning the model will go through the dataset three times during fine-tuning.\n",
        "1. `--output_dir tmp/bloomz-3b`: This sets the directory where the fine-tuned model and related outputs will be stored. In this case, it's set to the `tmp/bloomz-3b` directory.\n",
        "1. `--batch_size=2`: This sets the batch size used during training. The data will be divided into batches of 2 samples each.\n",
        "1. `--accumulate_steps 8`: This specifies the number of steps before gradients are accumulated and the weights are updated. It can be useful for larger batch sizes when the GPU memory is limited.\n",
        "1. `--max_source_length 512`: This is a flag to set the maximum length of the input sequence.\n",
        "1. `--metric rouge`: This sets the evaluation metric to ROUGE.\n",
        "1. `--torch_dtype bfloat16`: This specifies what dtype to use for the training. `float32` is considered 'full precision', though other options such as `float16` and `bfloat16` (known as half precision) also exist. `bfloat16` has wider range, but less precision than `float16` but is only available on Ampre class GPUs (such as the A100)\n",
